# Sutton 2nd Edition Textbook Exercises

This directory contains python scripts for various exercises from the "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction 2nd Edition" book by Sutton et al. 

### 10-armed Testbed

This script recreates Figure 2.2 in Section 2.3 by executing 2000 independent runs 
using the sample-average action-value method with three different settings (greedy, epsilon=0.01, and epsilon=0.1)

### Gambler's Problem

This script provides a solution to Exercise 4.9 (the Gambler's Problem). In this exercise we use dynamic programming and value iteration in order to approximate the optimal policy and value function associated with the Gambler's Problem (betting on a coin flip).
