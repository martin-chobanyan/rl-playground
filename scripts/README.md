# Reinforcement Learning Topics

This directory contains python scripts for various reinforcement learning projects and exercises.

### Maze Solver

This contains code for generating a random maze using Prim's algorithm, solving the maze using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, and solving the maze using value iteration with dynamic programming.

The reason for having both a Dijkstra solution and a reinforcement learning solution is to serve as a sanity check and make sure that the both solutions output the shortest path solution.
