This directory contains python scripts for various topics in reinforcement learning, 
primarily from the "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction 2nd Edition" by Sutton et al.

This script recreates Figure 2.2 in Section 2.3 by executing 2000 independent runs 
using the sample-average action-value method with three different settings (greedy, epsilon=0.01, and epsilon=0.1)
